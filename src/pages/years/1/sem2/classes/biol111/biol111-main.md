## Lecture 3 (Three) - January 23 2024 - 2024/01/23

### Learning Objectives

- Justify the important of carbon to biolmolecules
- define carbon fixation
- discuss the basic chemistry of the major biologically relevant macromolecules
- connect the general structures of biolmolecules to their typical functions.

### Building Blocks of Life

The main idea of life is about taking pieces, building blocks, etc, putting energy to make bigger molecules in anabolic processes, or breaking them down using catabolic processes.

Each chemical have specific properties that dictate their usage.

Some of the most commonly found elements in biologically relevant chemicals.

- Carbon
- Nitrogen
- Oxygen
- Hydrogen
- Phosphorus
- Sulphur

The chemicals associated with life are usually molecules that consist of covalently-bonded atoms in a specific arrangement. The arrangement determines a chemicalâ€™s shape, which determines its function. In covalent bonds electrons are shared between atoms to form a strong association.

Sometimes electrons are not shared equally between two covalently bonded atoms. Usually between hydrogen and strongly electronegative elements like oxygen or nitrogen. This results in a slight positive charge for the hydrogen, and a slight negative charge for the other atom

Hydrogen bonds are extremely biologically relevant. Hydrogen bonding results in many of the unique properties of water.

#### Carbon

Carbon can bond with 4 other atoms which allows the creation of very complex molecules.

Carbon containing compounds are sometimes called organic compounds.

- Organic molecules contain carbon bonded to other carbons or hydrogen
- Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide usually considered inorganic
  - it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds in CO/CO_2 and turn them into something biologically relevant.

Conversion from inorganic Carbon to biologically relevant Carbon requires a lot of energy. This process is called **Carbon fixation**, it is performed by **Autotrophs**. This is a crucial step of the Carbon cycle.

#### Classification of Biologically Relevant Chemicals

- Carbohydrates
- Proteins
- Lipids
- Nucleic Acids

##### Lipids

- Longs chains of carbon and hydrogen
- Important energy source
- Sometimes can form rings g(as in sterols)
- These don't interact well with water -- they are **Hydrophobic**
- Chains of Carbon and hydrogen are neutral in charge
- Only a small part of these molecules can interact with water, the parts associated with oxygen, places where Carbon bonds with oxygen. Again, these are the only parts that can interact with water. They don't mix, and they separate themselves out of the water.
- Lipids placed in water will arrange themselves in a way to "shield" the hydrophobic portions away from water. The lipid tails will associated themselves together, and the polar heads will interact with the environment and interact with water. This results in small "droplets" of fat, which are called **Micelles**.
- Long-chain lipids can be saturated or unsaturated. The key property of saturated fats is that they tend to be solid at room temperature, which has to do with the shape of the lipid. Unsaturated fats have a pronounced bend the molecule.

![Trans Fat](image.png)

Notice the trans fat, there are no (as far as prof. knows) natural processes that creates trans-fats. Most living things cannot process trans fats well. So they tend to build up our bodies and cells. Trans-fats are generally created during industrial processes

###### Phospholipids

They are very important to life. They have a polar head, and lipid tails. They form more cylindrical profiles, as opposed to saturated fats. Thus in water they form niche shapes. THey will try to shield the hydrophobic lipids tails behind the polar heads. The shape created by phospholipids interact can create a barrier between two aqueous areas. These barriers form the basis of cell membranes. This creates a **Liposome, or vesicle, or bicelle** this creates the barrier!!!

##### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates have a lot of oxygen in their structure. This makes them behave very different from lipids. They are NOT hydrophobic. Recall that sugar devolves in water. Sometimes called sugars (Sugars are only one type of carbohydrate). In its simplest forms, major carbohydrates have six Carbon atoms. They can form straight chains or wrap around to form rings. **Monosaccharides** are the primary energy-rich compounds broken down to produce energy! Glucose fuels our cells. Monosaccharide "subunits" (monomers), can be chained together ("polymerized") into increasingly complex sugars (polymers). TWo monosaccharides come together to form disaccharides.
![Various disaccharides forming from monosaccharides](image-1.png)Again, the structure is very important. They can even form longer structures **Oligo- and polysaccharides** they can server storage or structural purposes. Monosaccharides will be chained together for storage into starches, this is primary in plants. In animals we branch resulting in glycogen. Chains of glucose together can form cellulose. In animals, again things are different, we may structures such as **Chitin** (Consisting of slightly modified carbohydrates). The first usage is for energy, and larger chains, again, are stored. They can also form structural molecules. Starches are very long, structural chains are long.

###### Polymerization and biopolymers

We will see this pattern of repeating subunits being chained together into larger molecules often in biology!

- Monomer: The individual subunit
- Dimer: Two monomers chained together
- Trimer: Three monomers chained together
- Oligomer: a few (2,3,4,...) monomers chained together
- Polymer: Many monomers chained together.

##### Nucleic Acid

![Nucleic Acid (Nucleotide)](image-2.png)

This structure represents a **nucleotide** when these get chained that resulting chain is the nucleic acid. Nucleotide monomers polymerize to form nucleic acid. And nucleic acid polymers store information in cells.

##### Protein

![A protein](image-3.png)

Proteins are very complex. They are polymers of various **amino acids**. Each amino acid monomer has a unique "side chain". There are "20" kinds of amino acids relevant to life. Proteins do a very large amount of things within a cell. They are incredibly diverse in function.

### All together

All these functions and acids, proteins, lipids, and their barriers, glucose and their chains for structure and energy. These all come together in a cell to give a function. These basic compounds MAY for spontaneously, however this is incredibly slow. However, living things produce ALL major biological molecules with extreme efficiency. "Life has contributed significantly to the types and amounts of organic compounds on Earth" (Wong).
