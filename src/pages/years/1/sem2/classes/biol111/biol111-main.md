## Lecture 3 (Three) - January 23 2024 - 2024/01/23

### Learning Objectives

- Justify the important of carbon to biolmolecules
- define carbon fixation
- discuss the basic chemistry of the major biologically relevant macromolecules
- connect the general structures of biolmolecules to their typical functions.

### Building Blocks of Life

The main idea of life is about taking pieces, building blocks, etc, putting energy to make bigger molecules in anabolic processes, or breaking them down using catabolic processes.

Each chemical have specific properties that dictate their usage.

Some of the most commonly found elements in biologically relevant chemicals.

- Carbon
- Nitrogen
- Oxygen
- Hydrogen
- Phosphorus
- Sulphur

The chemicals associated with life are usually molecules that consist of covalently-bonded atoms in a specific arrangement. The arrangement determines a chemicalâ€™s shape, which determines its function. In covalent bonds electrons are shared between atoms to form a strong association.

Sometimes electrons are not shared equally between two covalently bonded atoms. Usually between hydrogen and strongly electronegative elements like oxygen or nitrogen. This results in a slight positive charge for the hydrogen, and a slight negative charge for the other atom

Hydrogen bonds are extremely biologically relevant. Hydrogen bonding results in many of the unique properties of water.

#### Carbon

Carbon can bond with 4 other atoms which allows the creation of very complex molecules.

Carbon containing compounds are sometimes called organic compounds.

- Organic molecules contain carbon bonded to other carbons or hydrogen
- Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide usually considered inorganic
  - it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds in CO/CO_2 and turn them into something biologically relevant.

Conversion from inorganic Carbon to biologically relevant Carbon requires a lot of energy. This process is called **Carbon fixation**, it is performed by **Autotrophs**. This is a crucial step of the Carbon cycle.

#### Classification of Biologically Relevant Chemicals

- Carbohydrates
- Proteins
- Lipids
- Nucleic Acids

##### Lipids

- Longs chains of carbon and hydrogen
- Important energy source
- Sometimes can form rings g(as in sterols)
- These don't interact well with water -- they are **Hydrophobic**
- Chains of Carbon and hydrogen are neutral in charge
- Only a small part of these molecules can interact with water, the parts associated with oxygen, places where Carbon bonds with oxygen. Again, these are the only parts that can interact with water. They don't mix, and they separate themselves out of the water.
- Lipids placed in water will arrange themselves in a way to "shield" the hydrophobic portions away from water. The lipid tails will associated themselves together, and the polar heads will interact with the environment and interact with water. This results in small "droplets" of fat, which are called **Micelles**.
- Long-chain lipids can be saturated or unsaturated. The key property of saturated fats is that they tend to be solid at room temperature, which has to do with the shape of the lipid. Unsaturated fats have a pronounced bend the molecule.

![Trans Fat](image.png)

Notice the trans fat, there are no (as far as prof. knows) natural processes that creates trans-fats. Most living things cannot process trans fats well. So they tend to build up our bodies and cells. Trans-fats are generally created during industrial processes

###### Phospholipids

They are very important to life. They have a polar head, and lipid tails. They form more cylindrical profiles, as opposed to saturated fats. Thus in water they form niche shapes. THey will try to shield the hydrophobic lipids tails behind the polar heads. The shape created by phospholipids interact can create a barrier between two aqueous areas. These barriers form the basis of cell membranes. This creates a **Liposome, or vesicle, or bicelle** this creates the barrier!!!

##### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates have a lot of oxygen in their structure. This makes them behave very different from lipids. They are NOT hydrophobic. Recall that sugar devolves in water. Sometimes called sugars (Sugars are only one type of carbohydrate). In its simplest forms, major carbohydrates have six Carbon atoms. They can form straight chains or wrap around to form rings. **Monosaccharides** are the primary energy-rich compounds broken down to produce energy! Glucose fuels our cells. Monosaccharide "subunits" (monomers), can be chained together ("polymerized") into increasingly complex sugars (polymers). TWo monosaccharides come together to form disaccharides.
![Various disaccharides forming from monosaccharides](image-1.png)Again, the structure is very important. They can even form longer structures **Oligo- and polysaccharides** they can server storage or structural purposes. Monosaccharides will be chained together for storage into starches, this is primary in plants. In animals we branch resulting in glycogen. Chains of glucose together can form cellulose. In animals, again things are different, we may structures such as **Chitin** (Consisting of slightly modified carbohydrates). The first usage is for energy, and larger chains, again, are stored. They can also form structural molecules. Starches are very long, structural chains are long.

###### Polymerization and biopolymers

We will see this pattern of repeating subunits being chained together into larger molecules often in biology!

- Monomer: The individual subunit
- Dimer: Two monomers chained together
- Trimer: Three monomers chained together
- Oligomer: a few (2,3,4,...) monomers chained together
- Polymer: Many monomers chained together.

##### Nucleic Acid

![Nucleic Acid (Nucleotide)](image-2.png)

This structure represents a **nucleotide** when these get chained that resulting chain is the nucleic acid. Nucleotide monomers polymerize to form nucleic acid. And nucleic acid polymers store information in cells.

##### Protein

![A protein](image-3.png)

Proteins are very complex. They are polymers of various **amino acids**. Each amino acid monomer has a unique "side chain". There are "20" kinds of amino acids relevant to life. Proteins do a very large amount of things within a cell. They are incredibly diverse in function.

### All together

All these functions and acids, proteins, lipids, and their barriers, glucose and their chains for structure and energy. These all come together in a cell to give a function. These basic compounds MAY for spontaneously, however this is incredibly slow. However, living things produce ALL major biological molecules with extreme efficiency. "Life has contributed significantly to the types and amounts of organic compounds on Earth" (Wong).

## Lecture 4 (Four) . January 25th 2024 . 2024/01/25

### Learning Objectives lec4

Describe the major functions of proteins and nucleic acids

- Compare and contrast DNA and RNA
- Identify the five major nucleotides by name and letter
- Explain how nucleotides are used as energy currency
- Recognize the structure of polymeric nucleic acids and its polarity
- Recognize the importance of base pairing with respect to the structure,
- unction, and replication of nucleic acids
- Explain why double-stranded nucleic acid strands are considered antiparallel
- Explain the functional importance of protein folding
- Connect the lock-and-key model of enzyme function to protein folding

### Nucleic Acids

#### Key points

- Polymers of Nucleotides
- 2 types of nucleic acids
  - DNA & RNA
- 5 kinds of Nucleotides
  - Each type of nucleic acid only contains 4 of the 5
- Nucleic acids primarily store genetic information

#### Nucleic Acid Vocabulary

- **Base**: Determines the identity of the nucleotide
- **Nucleoside**: The ribose sugar + base
- **Nucleotide**: Sugar + base + 1 to 3 phosphates

![Nucleotides that form DNA](image-4.png)

Figure 9.3 from _Concepts of Biology_

DNA is composed of 4 different nucleotides. The four bases have different structures that confer identity.

**Note:**: No need to memorize these structures.

#### DNA vs. RNA

RNA uses ribose, while DNA uses deoxyribose.

Deoxyribose, notice the _de_ prefix, it is missing an oxygen that is found in the Ribose. This is the reason that RNA is much less stable tan DNA.

RNA uses uracil (U), while DNA uses thymine (T). Uracil (U) still base pairs with adenine (A).

#### Base pairing

Each nucleotide specifically pairs with another

- A pairs with T (or U in RNA)
- G pairs with C

In RNA, A pairs with U instead.

The number of bonds affects the strength of interaction.

Chains of nucleotides have directionality

- We call the end with the phosphate 5' ("five prime")
- The end with a hydroxyl is called 3' ("three prime")
  - New nucleotides are added at 3' end.

One chain, or "strands" interacts with its complementary strand

The complementary strand runs in the opposite direction -- the strands are "antiparallel".

![Anti parallel strands bonded](image-5.png)

This pairing is what forms the double helix shape we know so well.

Sequences of different nucleotides encode information. Think of nucleotides like letters that make words. The order that different nucleotides are joined to form nucleic acids is critical.

- For example: "ATCG is not the same as CAGT" (Wong 14 "Lecture 4").

Consider the sequence

"**5'**GCACGGAGACCAAGACTTAATGTGGTGGGA**3'**" (Wong, 14)

The complementary sequence is

"**3'**CGTGCCTC ... CT**5'**" (Wong, 14).

Recall that strands are anti-parallel, meaning that the ends will be opposite each other for each strand relative to the next.

#### RNA Structure

Single-stranded RNA can fold in different, characteristic ways.

![RNA Structures](image-6.png)

Thus, RNA can form specific structures that perform specific functions.

RNA tend to be single stranded running 5' -> 3'. However, instead of pairing with other molecules, it more often pairs with itself in interesting shapes. The following shapes are very complex. These specific shapes/structures allow the RNA to perform functions in the cell (Not to the same extent as proteins).

#### Nucleic acids on their own can also be

##### temporary high-energy molecules

- temporary high-energy molecules in cells: Energy from breaking down sugars and lipids are usually not directly used for a cell function that needs it! Energy is stored in individual nucleotides (typically ATP or GTP) that can be used universally throughout the cell in a variety of functions. It is sort of like converting all the types of sugars, that have specific idiosyncrasies, etc., to typical uniform nucleotides that can be used throughout the cell. **Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)**: Has extra phosphates, and transfers energy from broken down sugars and fats to various cellular functions. The part which determines the identity of a nucleotide that decides the type of nucleotide is the **base**. ![gtp/atp different example](image-7.png) here is an image of the base; that part that would differ between ATP & GTP.
![Energy flow schematic](image-8.png)

We are essentially just transferring the energy from bonds in lipids & sugars to ATP.

Different sugars/fats produce different levels of ATP.

When glucose is fermented without oxygen only 2 molecules of ATP are produced.

When we exercise and use more oxygen than we bring in our cells will fall back to fermentation for ATP.

In the presence of Oxygen and using mitochondria will yield a 36x ATP yield.

Consider Palmitic acid (saturated fatty acid) with oxygen and mitochondria present will yield a 100x ATP yield. This highlights the efficacy of lipids as storage.

### Proteins


#### Key facts

- Polymers of various amino acids.
- Each amino acid monomer has a unique "Side chain"
- There are "20" kinds of amino acids relevant to life
- Proteins do all sorts of things in the cell, they are the most diverse in function.

All biological entities will contain proteins.

#### Proteins Vocabulary

- Amino acids: the fundamental units (monomers) that make up proteins -- at least 20 different ones
- Peptides: Short(ish) chains of amino acids (<30 amino acids)
- Proteins long(ish) chains of amino acids (>30, but no clear definition (can be even thousands))

#### Proteins main

The amino groups of one amino acid joins to the carboxyl group of the previous one. Free amino groups are known as "N-terminus" and Carboxyl ends are called the "C-Terminus" and new amino acids are added to this end.

Example:

- "Beefy meaty peptide" has eight amino acids, the types of amino acids the chain contains determine its property.

Proteins can thus be defined by their amino acid sequence.

![Beefy Meaty Peptide](image-9.png)

This peptide contains the following amino acids in this order:\
"Lys-Gly-Asp-Glu-Glu-Ser-Leu-Ala"

Some Proteins

- Insulin
- Lactase

Structural

- Keratin
- Collagen
- Gluten (Plant Protein - Wheat)

Proteins play a variety of functions inside and outside cells!

including, but not limited to:

- Enzymes (proteins that help reactions proceed)
- Structural proteins.
- Transporter proteins
- Binding proteins
- Cofactors (helps another protein)
- Molecular tags (activates or deactivates other proteins)
- Hormones, etc.

##### Enzymes

Essential chemical reactions still occur far too slowly too sustain life if unaided.

![Reaction with text & glucose floating around](image-10.png)

Glucose + Glucose = Maltose (malt sugar) unaided would result in floating glucose. In the cell, however, an enzyme will hold the glucose together in a pair to form the maltose. The enzyme would require a specific shape for this reaction. For this proteins need to fold.

Proteins fold into a specific structures or conformations! Different parts of the amino acid chain can interact with each other to allow this to happen.

In protein hydrogen usually is the bond which holds the amino acid chain together to create the protein fold arrangement.

The shape of a protein is crucial for its function.

![Immunoglobulin (Antibody)](image-11.png)

Immunoglobulin has a specific shape that interacts with bad things to save your body from sicknesses.

![ATP synthase](image-12.png)


![Clathrin](image-13.png)

Enzymes need to be in specific shapes to help speed up chemical reactions essential for life.

![Hexokinase doing stuff](image-14.png)

The proteins shape and function is determined by the chain of amino acids & side chains & the order of amino acid the _sequence_

In covid-19 computing power was used to determine the way that proteins would fold given the sequence of amino acids.
