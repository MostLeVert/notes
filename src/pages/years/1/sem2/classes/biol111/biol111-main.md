## Lecture 3 20240123

### Learning Objectives

- Justify the important of carbon to biolmolecules
- define carbon fixation
- discuss the basic chemistry of the major biologically relevant macromolecules
- connect the general structures of biolmolecules to their typical functions.

### Building Blocks of Life

The main idea of life is about taking pieces, building blocks, etc, putting energy to make bigger molecules in anabolic processes, or breaking them down using catabolic processes.

Each chemical have specific properties that dictate their usage.

Some of the most commonly found elements in biologically relevant chemicals.

- Carbon
- Nitrogen
- Oxygen
- Hydrogen
- Phosphorus
- Sulphur

The chemicals associated with life are usually molecules that consist of covalently-bonded atoms in a specific arrangement. The arrangement determines a chemical’s shape, which determines its function. In covalent bonds electrons are shared between atoms to form a strong association.

Sometimes electrons are not shared equally between two covalently bonded atoms. Usually between hydrogen and strongly electronegative elements like oxygen or nitrogen. This results in a slight positive charge for the hydrogen, and a slight negative charge for the other atom

Hydrogen bonds are extremely biologically relevant. Hydrogen bonding results in many of the unique properties of water.

#### Carbon

Carbon can bond with 4 other atoms which allows the creation of very complex molecules.

Carbon containing compounds are sometimes called organic compounds.

- Organic molecules contain carbon bonded to other carbons or hydrogen
- Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide usually considered inorganic
  - it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds in CO/CO_2 and turn them into something biologically relevant.

Conversion from inorganic Carbon to biologically relevant Carbon requires a lot of energy. This process is called **Carbon fixation**, it is performed by **Autotrophs**. This is a crucial step of the Carbon cycle.

#### Classification of Biologically Relevant Chemicals

- Carbohydrates
- Proteins
- Lipids
- Nucleic Acids

##### Lipids

- Longs chains of carbon and hydrogen
- Important energy source
- Sometimes can form rings g(as in sterols)
- These don't interact well with water -- they are **Hydrophobic**
- Chains of Carbon and hydrogen are neutral in charge
- Only a small part of these molecules can interact with water, the parts associated with oxygen, places where Carbon bonds with oxygen. Again, these are the only parts that can interact with water. They don't mix, and they separate themselves out of the water.
- Lipids placed in water will arrange themselves in a way to "shield" the hydrophobic portions away from water. The lipid tails will associated themselves together, and the polar heads will interact with the environment and interact with water. This results in small "droplets" of fat, which are called **Micelles**.
- Long-chain lipids can be saturated or unsaturated. The key property of saturated fats is that they tend to be solid at room temperature, which has to do with the shape of the lipid. Unsaturated fats have a pronounced bend the molecule.

![Trans Fat](image.png)

Notice the trans fat, there are no (as far as prof. knows) natural processes that creates trans-fats. Most living things cannot process trans fats well. So they tend to build up our bodies and cells. Trans-fats are generally created during industrial processes

###### Phospholipids

They are very important to life. They have a polar head, and lipid tails. They form more cylindrical profiles, as opposed to saturated fats. Thus in water they form niche shapes. THey will try to shield the hydrophobic lipids tails behind the polar heads. The shape created by phospholipids interact can create a barrier between two aqueous areas. These barriers form the basis of cell membranes. This creates a **Liposome, or vesicle, or bicelle** this creates the barrier!!!

##### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates have a lot of oxygen in their structure. This makes them behave very different from lipids. They are NOT hydrophobic. Recall that sugar devolves in water. Sometimes called sugars (Sugars are only one type of carbohydrate). In its simplest forms, major carbohydrates have six Carbon atoms. They can form straight chains or wrap around to form rings. **Monosaccharides** are the primary energy-rich compounds broken down to produce energy! Glucose fuels our cells. Monosaccharide "subunits" (monomers), can be chained together ("polymerized") into increasingly complex sugars (polymers). TWo monosaccharides come together to form disaccharides.
![Various disaccharides forming from monosaccharides](image-1.png)Again, the structure is very important. They can even form longer structures **Oligo- and polysaccharides** they can server storage or structural purposes. Monosaccharides will be chained together for storage into starches, this is primary in plants. In animals we branch resulting in glycogen. Chains of glucose together can form cellulose. In animals, again things are different, we may structures such as **Chitin** (Consisting of slightly modified carbohydrates). The first usage is for energy, and larger chains, again, are stored. They can also form structural molecules. Starches are very long, structural chains are long.

###### Polymerization and biopolymers

We will see this pattern of repeating subunits being chained together into larger molecules often in biology!

- Monomer: The individual subunit
- Dimer: Two monomers chained together
- Trimer: Three monomers chained together
- Oligomer: a few (2,3,4,...) monomers chained together
- Polymer: Many monomers chained together.

##### Nucleic Acid

![Nucleic Acid (Nucleotide)](image-2.png)

This structure represents a **nucleotide** when these get chained that resulting chain is the nucleic acid. Nucleotide monomers polymerize to form nucleic acid. And nucleic acid polymers store information in cells.

##### Protein

![A protein](image-3.png)

Proteins are very complex. They are polymers of various **amino acids**. Each amino acid monomer has a unique "side chain". There are "20" kinds of amino acids relevant to life. Proteins do a very large amount of things within a cell. They are incredibly diverse in function.

### All together

All these functions and acids, proteins, lipids, and their barriers, glucose and their chains for structure and energy. These all come together in a cell to give a function. These basic compounds MAY for spontaneously, however this is incredibly slow. However, living things produce ALL major biological molecules with extreme efficiency. "Life has contributed significantly to the types and amounts of organic compounds on Earth" (Wong).

## Lecture 4 20240125

### Learning Objectives lec4

Describe the major functions of proteins and nucleic acids

- Compare and contrast DNA and RNA
- Identify the five major nucleotides by name and letter
- Explain how nucleotides are used as energy currency
- Recognize the structure of polymeric nucleic acids and its polarity
- Recognize the importance of base pairing with respect to the structure,
- unction, and replication of nucleic acids
- Explain why double-stranded nucleic acid strands are considered antiparallel
- Explain the functional importance of protein folding
- Connect the lock-and-key model of enzyme function to protein folding

### Nucleic Acids

#### Key points

- Polymers of Nucleotides
- 2 types of nucleic acids
  - DNA & RNA
- 5 kinds of Nucleotides
  - Each type of nucleic acid only contains 4 of the 5
- Nucleic acids primarily store genetic information

#### Nucleic Acid Vocabulary

- **Base**: Determines the identity of the nucleotide
- **Nucleoside**: The ribose sugar + base
- **Nucleotide**: Sugar + base + 1 to 3 phosphates

![Nucleotides that form DNA](image-4.png)

Figure 9.3 from _Concepts of Biology_

DNA is composed of 4 different nucleotides. The four bases have different structures that confer identity.

**Note:**: No need to memorize these structures.

#### DNA vs. RNA

RNA uses ribose, while DNA uses deoxyribose.

Deoxyribose, notice the _de_ prefix, it is missing an oxygen that is found in the Ribose. This is the reason that RNA is much less stable tan DNA.

RNA uses uracil (U), while DNA uses thymine (T). Uracil (U) still base pairs with adenine (A).

#### Base pairing

Each nucleotide specifically pairs with another

- A pairs with T (or U in RNA)
- G pairs with C

In RNA, A pairs with U instead.

The number of bonds affects the strength of interaction.

Chains of nucleotides have directionality

- We call the end with the phosphate 5' ("five prime")
- The end with a hydroxyl is called 3' ("three prime")
  - New nucleotides are added at 3' end.

One chain, or "strands" interacts with its complementary strand

The complementary strand runs in the opposite direction -- the strands are "antiparallel".

![Anti parallel strands bonded](image-5.png)

This pairing is what forms the double helix shape we know so well.

Sequences of different nucleotides encode information. Think of nucleotides like letters that make words. The order that different nucleotides are joined to form nucleic acids is critical.

- For example: "ATCG is not the same as CAGT" (Wong 14 "Lecture 4").

Consider the sequence

"**5'**GCACGGAGACCAAGACTTAATGTGGTGGGA**3'**" (Wong, 14)

The complementary sequence is

"**3'**CGTGCCTC ... CT**5'**" (Wong, 14).

Recall that strands are anti-parallel, meaning that the ends will be opposite each other for each strand relative to the next.

#### RNA Structure

Single-stranded RNA can fold in different, characteristic ways.

![RNA Structures](image-6.png)

Thus, RNA can form specific structures that perform specific functions.

RNA tend to be single stranded running 5' -> 3'. However, instead of pairing with other molecules, it more often pairs with itself in interesting shapes. The following shapes are very complex. These specific shapes/structures allow the RNA to perform functions in the cell (Not to the same extent as proteins).

#### Nucleic acids on their own can also be

##### temporary high-energy molecules

- temporary high-energy molecules in cells: Energy from breaking down sugars and lipids are usually not directly used for a cell function that needs it! Energy is stored in individual nucleotides (typically ATP or GTP) that can be used universally throughout the cell in a variety of functions. It is sort of like converting all the types of sugars, that have specific idiosyncrasies, etc., to typical uniform nucleotides that can be used throughout the cell. **Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)**: Has extra phosphates, and transfers energy from broken down sugars and fats to various cellular functions. The part which determines the identity of a nucleotide that decides the type of nucleotide is the **base**. ![gtp/atp different example](image-7.png) here is an image of the base; that part that would differ between ATP & GTP.
![Energy flow schematic](image-8.png)

We are essentially just transferring the energy from bonds in lipids & sugars to ATP.

Different sugars/fats produce different levels of ATP.

When glucose is fermented without oxygen only 2 molecules of ATP are produced.

When we exercise and use more oxygen than we bring in our cells will fall back to fermentation for ATP.

In the presence of Oxygen and using mitochondria will yield a 36x ATP yield.

Consider Palmitic acid (saturated fatty acid) with oxygen and mitochondria present will yield a 100x ATP yield. This highlights the efficacy of lipids as storage.

### Proteins

#### Key facts

- Polymers of various amino acids.
- Each amino acid monomer has a unique "Side chain"
- There are "20" kinds of amino acids relevant to life
- Proteins do all sorts of things in the cell, they are the most diverse in function.

All biological entities will contain proteins.

#### Proteins Vocabulary

- Amino acids: the fundamental units (monomers) that make up proteins -- at least 20 different ones
- Peptides: Short(ish) chains of amino acids (<30 amino acids)
- Proteins long(ish) chains of amino acids (>30, but no clear definition (can be even thousands))

#### Proteins main

The amino groups of one amino acid joins to the carboxyl group of the previous one. Free amino groups are known as "N-terminus" and Carboxyl ends are called the "C-Terminus" and new amino acids are added to this end.

Example:

- "Beefy meaty peptide" has eight amino acids, the types of amino acids the chain contains determine its property.

Proteins can thus be defined by their amino acid sequence.

![Beefy Meaty Peptide](image-9.png)

This peptide contains the following amino acids in this order:\
"Lys-Gly-Asp-Glu-Glu-Ser-Leu-Ala"

Some Proteins

- Insulin
- Lactase

Structural

- Keratin
- Collagen
- Gluten (Plant Protein - Wheat)

Proteins play a variety of functions inside and outside cells!

including, but not limited to:

- Enzymes (proteins that help reactions proceed)
- Structural proteins.
- Transporter proteins
- Binding proteins
- Cofactors (helps another protein)
- Molecular tags (activates or deactivates other proteins)
- Hormones, etc.

##### Enzymes

Essential chemical reactions still occur far too slowly too sustain life if unaided.

![Reaction with text & glucose floating around](image-10.png)

Glucose + Glucose = Maltose (malt sugar) unaided would result in floating glucose. In the cell, however, an enzyme will hold the glucose together in a pair to form the maltose. The enzyme would require a specific shape for this reaction. For this proteins need to fold.

Proteins fold into a specific structures or conformations! Different parts of the amino acid chain can interact with each other to allow this to happen.

In protein hydrogen usually is the bond which holds the amino acid chain together to create the protein fold arrangement.

The shape of a protein is crucial for its function.

![Immunoglobulin (Antibody)](image-11.png)

Immunoglobulin has a specific shape that interacts with bad things to save your body from sicknesses.

![ATP synthase](image-12.png)

![Clathrin](image-13.png)

Enzymes need to be in specific shapes to help speed up chemical reactions essential for life.

![Hexokinase doing stuff](image-14.png)

The proteins shape and function is determined by the chain of amino acids & side chains & the order of amino acid the _sequence_

In covid-19 computing power was used to determine the way that proteins would fold given the sequence of amino acids.

## Lecture 5 Cellular Structure and Dynamics 20240130

### The Cell

At a minimum, cells have 4 things.

- Plasma Membrane
- DNA
- Cytoplasm
- Ribosomes

There are two very distinct kinds of cells on Earth.

![Figure 1.9 from Concepts of Biology](image-15.png)

There are essentially 3 domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya.

All cells are thought to have evolved from LUCA 3.5 to 3.8 B years ago. (LUCA means Last Universal Common Ancestor)

![LUCA](image-16.png)

#### Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes

Karyotes refers to a sort of kernel, the pro prefix means before; so, it's "before nucleus".

#### Biological Membranes

All life makes use of biological membranes

These are very important in separating the outside world from the inside (plasma membrane)

But things still need to get across membranes

All biological membranes are selectively permeable.

Semi-permeable, selective barriers

Mostly made of phospholipids (lipids with phosphate groups) and proteins with highly specialized functions

We consider biological membranes a “fluid mosaic”. We call it a mosaic because it is composed of many kinds of pieces and colors, etc., many components come together to form functional unit. It is in reference to the diversity of components (most of which are phospholipids). If a protein isn't fixed (some are) then it could move around within the membrane. This is important to the overall functioning of the cell.

![Cell Membrane. Figure 3.18 Concepts of Biology](image-18.png)

The majority of the membrane will be lipids (recall the water attraction and repulsion).

Cholesterol: modulates the fluidity/flexibility of the membrane. It can do this because it fits in the space between the phospholipids. It can change the flexibility of the membrane. It will make it a bit more structurally sound.

Proteins do many things in the cell wall. They channel materials through it, they can act as enzymes to speed up reactions, etc., they can respond to stimuli. They acn also be structural; attachment points for various things.

Carbohydrates tend only to face outside of the cell because carbohydrates are more used as signalling molecules for the cell's neighbors. It helps other cells recognize the type of cell that it's attached to. Carbohydrates also have other specialized functions that may be covered it later biology courses.

#### Demonstrating Membrane fluidity

Imagine if we lased off a florescent coating from the water attracting heads of the membrane. This would be "bleaching". What takes place after the lasing as occurred: Imagine a drop of food coloring in water, it will dissipate throughout the membrane. This is called "FRAP: Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching.

#### The Plasma Membrane

The plasma membrane separates the outside world from the inside, but things still need to get across!

What needs to go in and out of the cell:

- Water
- Waste,
- etc.

#### Crossing the membrane

Gasses (e.g. Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide) and hydrophobic molecules diffuse freely across lipid bilayers.

Small uncharged polar molecules diffuse moderately easily through the lipid bilayers.

Diffusion of large uncharged polar molecules across lipid bilayers is minimal, and is difficult.

Charged substances (ions) cannot diffuse across the lipid layer.

Passive transport does not require energy input Large substances may still require a protein to server as channel or pore as pathway through the membrane.

Movement is WITH a concentration gradient.

Note that facilitated transport is in fact, passive.

##### Diffusion

Dissolved materials moving from areas of higher concentration to lower concentration

##### Osmosis

water moving from an area of lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration.

Net water movement across a selecively permeable membrane toward area with higher solute concentration.

Note that cells have a high solute concentration, so they have developed different strategies to handle osmosis

##### Active Transportation Systems

For substances that are too big, have electric charge; particles that cannot passively cross the membrane.

Ex. Protons are pumped against a concentration gradient. ATP will under go hydrolysis -- it break down and transfer energy to the protein such that the proton can be transported.

Possible trick question: NET transport; a freely diffusible molecule may exhibit movement, but if its concentration on either side of the membrane is equal then there will be NO NET movement.

#### Endocytosis

Endo meaning "inside" and -Cyto meaning "something to do with cells"

Things that are too large (like prey bacteria) for membrane proteins must be endocytosed -- This is allowed by a flexible membrane.

Endocytosis will occure in the 10-100 micrometer range of size.

Some cells have both walls and an ability to undergo phagocytosis; this is possible through an area of the cell wall that contains a more flexible section.

#### Exocytosis

- Essentialy the reverse of endocytosis

- Vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release (secrete) its contents

## L6 Cells

### L6 Cells Learning Objectives

- Depict a generalized prokaryotic cell
- Compare and contrast the basic features of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
- Describe the general features of eukaryotic cells and their functions
- Compare and contrast a generalized animal and plant cell
- Distinguish between mitochondria and plastids
- Defend the endosymbiotic theory with supporting evidence

### Organelles

Eukaryotes especially have a large variety of organelles within their cells. Prokaryotes are like a warehouse; eukaryotes are more like a room with cubicles.

Cells may have many differing numbers of various organelles; this sort of goes against the textbook diagrams of the cells that may oversimplify for the learning process.

Consider a sperm cell which is a nucleus with a small amount of mitochondria to power it; but fat cells are extremely basic; this is the same for red blood cells, they do not have much of anything besides oxygen in them.

All this is to say that we must consider the differences between various cells. We should be clear that textbook representations are not accurate for all cells; they are a general guide for learning.

### The Cytoskeleton

Eukaryotes have a complex network of pieces making up the cytoskeleton; prokaryotes have only cytoskeletal proteins.

#### Major Functions

- Structural and mechanical support for the cell

### The Endomembrane System

Eukaryotes have an extensive network of internal membranes we call the endomembrane system.

![Electron microscope image of cytoplasm](image-19.png)

### The Nucleus

The endomembrane system's membranes connect with the nuclear envelope, which surround the nucleus.

Muscle Tissue has multiple nuclei; skeletal muscle can have hundreds of nuclei.
Red blood cells do not have nucleus; they are oxygen bags (LOL).

#### The Nucleus Major Functions

- Storage of genetic information
- Location where gene expression beings
- Ribosomal subunits are assembled here

### The Endoplasmic Reticulum

Moving outwards from the nuclear envelope, the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form an extensive network that reaches the edges of the cell.

![An endoplasmic Reticulum Diagram](image-20.png)

### Endoplasmic Reticulum Major Functions

- Material circulate within this network
- Protein productions/modification (RER)
- Lipid synthesis (mostly SER).
- Synthesis of other biological molecules

![Detailed image of endoplasmic reticulum](image-21.png)

The RER is rough due to being covered in ribosomes

### The Golgi Apparatus

A factory in which proteins received from the ER are further processed and sorted for transport to their eventual destinations: lysosomes, the plasma membrane, or secretion

#### Golgi Apparatus Major Functions

- "Sorting center" of the cells
  - Materials could be leaving cell
  - or to the lysosome
- More chemical modifications

### Lysosomes

Acidic and violent, lysosomes digest ingested or wornout substances to recycle the components

Membrane-enclosed organelles that contain an array of enzymes capable of breaking down all types of biological polymers—proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.

Note: Plant cells aren't thought of has having lysosomes

#### Lysosomes Major Functions

- Enzymes inside digest biological molecules
- Digests ingested prey
- Breaks down cellular components

### Vesicles and Vacuoles

Various other membrane-bound components move around the cell, such as vesicles & vacuoles.

Membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport.

#### Vesicles and Vacuoles Major Functions

- Movement of substances from one part of the cell to another
  - Or to the plasma membrane
- Areas where substances are stored (Generic storage)
- "Vesicle" reserved for smaller structures, "vacuole" for larger

### Mitochondria

Powerhouse of the cell

Mitochondria are membrane-bound cell organelles (mitochondrion, singular) that generate most of the chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions.

![Detailed image of a mitochondria](image-22.png)

#### Mitochondria Major Functions

- ATP production through oxidation of products from the breakdown of glucose and lipids

### Chloroplasts

Using the sun, the **Double-Membraned** chloroplasts generate lots of ATP for ... itself to make organic carbon.

An organelle within the cells of plants and certain algae that is the site of photosynthesis, which is the process by which energy from the Sun is converted into chemical energy for growth.

#### Chloroplasts Major Functions

- Photosynthesis
- ATP Production via light energy
  - ATP remains within the chloroplast
- ATP used to produce pieces of carbohydrates
- Productions of specialized things

#### Carbon Fixation and photosynthesis

It takes a lot of energy to convert carbon dioxide into something biologically relevant (Carbon fixation).

#### Mitochondria & Chloroplasts

Mitochondria and chloroplasts are heavily involved in energy production, and their structures and origins set them apart from the endomembrane system! How did eukaryotes get these organelles?

##### Endosymbiotic Theory

The cytoskeleton and endocytosis allowed for the acquisition of two very important eukaryotic organelles, mitochondria and plastids (of which chloroplasts is one type). Imagine a eukaryote eating bacteria (as food). But what if the food never got digested and somehow escaped into the eukaryote’s cytoplasm? What was the food like?

The establishment of mitochondria and chloroplasts opened up new lifestyles for eukaryotes, and brought photosynthesis into this domain of life.

Cell still has most control over the mitochondria; however, there are disease caused by a broken mitochondrial system.

###### Evidence for Endosymbiotic Theory

Mitochondria and chloroplasts really looked like (and even divide like) bacteria. They also divide independently of its host cell. These organelles maintain their a genome of their own DNA.

## L7 The Genetic Basis of Life

Genome = all the genetic materials in an organism passed from parent offspring
Gene = a hereditary unit passed from parent to offspring

- A segment of a genome that is transcribed into functional RNA

### DNA Replication

Before cells divide, its genome needs to be faithfully replicated so that one copy can be passed into each of the progeny cells.

Consider:

- What does the structure of a double-stranded molecule of DNA look like? How is it held together?
- To where are the nucleotides added to a DNA molecule

![Molecule of DNA as sequence of letters](image-23.png)

The steps to take to complete a replication.

- We need to unwind the DNA

1 in 100000 nucleotides are added in error.

Don't worry -- DNA pol has proofreading abilities to stop replication anf ix the error before continuing!
_But some errors still slip through_

Humans have around 20,000 genes; in our genomes. They all end up getting interpreted by the various components and complexes in our cells. Genes are:

- Units of heredity
- Segments of DNA
- transcribed into RNA
- if mRNA, then translated into protein.

Recall RNA uses ribose, while DNA uses deoxyribose; making DNA much more stable than RNA, RNA also uses uracil (U), while DNA uses Thymine (T).

### The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

That which links together DNA, RNA and proteins, as well as the flow of genetic information in **ALL** life.

![DNA -> RNA -> PROTEIN](image-24.png)

Information from one gets passed to the other; the order of the nucleotides. DNA is a permanent store of information, then RNA is a temporary relay of the information, and protein is the interpretation of the information. Key here is the realization that we are working in information. Everything is information, the world is information, a state of that which is not in the purest form of mean energy that is, entropy is a still a process which can execute in it of itself.

DNA -> RNA is "transcription"
RNA -> Protein is "translation"

We can think of DNA (Genome) as a cookbook, with RNA being a part of the genome; a recipe copied from the cookbook; translation would be the same as cooking the recipe.

There are differences, but the order and direction of information flow is the same for bacteria and eukaryotes.

#### Anatomy of a Gene

All genes include some number of regulatory sequences.

Terminators are regions where RNA polymerases detach to end transcription.

Genes have directionality on the genome.

The promoter is usually "upstream" of the coding region, while the terminator is "downstream"

Genes can run in either direction on a chromosome

Regardless of the type of gene and the resulting gene product, the first step to gene expression is transcription this segment of DNA will be transcribed to RNA.

#### Transcription

1. Initiation of transcription
2. Extension/elongation of RNA by RNA polymerase
3. Termination

##### Initiation

- Transcription starts at transcription start (initiation) site
  - This is where the first nucleotide of the RNA strand is recruited
- Promoters contain sequences the RNA polymerase complex recognizes
  - Its specific sequence and direction ensure that transcription occurs in the proper direction, so that the fundamental sequences are actually in the resulting RNA
- Other upstream regulatory sequences may be present
  - Enhancers/activators increase frequency of transcription of that gene
  - Regressors/inhibitors decrease frequency of transcription of that gene

Eukaryotic transcription complex

RNA polymerase binds to the promoter region and forms a giant complex with other proteins that bind to regulatory regions like enhancers.

##### Elongation

The next nucleotide polymerase adds is complementary to and base pairs with the next nucleotide on the template strand.

##### Termination

All RNA Pol will do is keep adding nucleotides unless something makes it stop/terminate

The terminator contains a sequence that results in the end in the end of transcription. This is mediated by another protein.

## L8

### L8 Learning Objectives

- Functionally differentiate between mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA
- Describe the concept of the universal genetic code with respect to translation, codons, and tRNA function
- Describe briefly the steps involved in translation
- Use the codon table to determine peptide sequences from mRNA
- Explain what is meant by a degenerate genetic code
- Connect the effects of mutations to larger scale functional
changes

### L8 Transcript Functions

The content of mRNA is different between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

#### L8 Transcript Functions eukaryotes

mRNA usually represent a single gene, and codes for a single product (one coding sequence).

#### L8 Transcript Functions prokaryotes

mRNA carries a series of functionally-related genes (an "operon") that code for multiple products (multiple coding sequences).

### L8 Translation

RNA -> Protein

This is the process by which mRNA are translated into functional proteins.

- The sequence information represented in the mRNA transcript is now "decoded" to represent any possible ammino acid.

1. Initiation
2. Elongation
3. Termination

#### L8 Translation Initiation

Translation initiation in eukaryotes starts with tRNA and small ribosomal subunit recruitment by initiation factors at the 5' cap.

Then the complex starts scanning for start codon AUG, in the 5' to 3' direction.

Once the start codon (AUG) is detected, the large ribosome unit attaches with the first tRNA in the P (peptidyl) site.

Beginning synthesis at the start codon establishes the reading frame.

#### L8 Translation Elongation

Next, the second tRNA enters the ribosome at the A (aminoacyl) site, and the first bond that is is made links the C-terminus of methionine (Met) to the N-Terminus of the next amino acid (in this example, valine or Val).

The entire complex moves toward the 3' end of the mRNA by exactly 1 codon

- Codons do not overlap!
- The first tRNA moves into the E (exit) site and is ejected
- The second tRNA moves into the P site, and the next tRNA enters the A site (and the process repeats).

#### L8 Translation Reading Frames

The consequence of having the code in sets of three bases is that there exists three possible reading frames.

![Reading Frame](image-26.png)

Each of these reading frames would produce a different protein!

The ribosome uses the reading frame established by the start codon.

**The reading frame is critical for correct protein synthesis!**

Consider the following uses three-letter English words:

_THEBIGBOYSAWTHEBADMANRUN_ If we start with "THE", it has meaning: "The big boy saw the bad man run."

if we shift our reading by frame by just adding a letter to the beginning, you get something that makes no sense. (Frameshift is actually used to describe this kind of mutation!)

_XTHEBIGBOYSSAWTHEBADMANRUN_ Now means: "Xth ebi gbo ysa wth eba dma nru n" (which makes no sense)

#### L8 Translation Termination

Eventually a stop codon (UGA, UAA, UAG) is reached, an amino acid chain gets cut off the tRNA in the P site and everything disassembles.

A release factor will be brought meaning its time to stop, everything will detach and disassemble, the subunits will come apart and go away to go be used again.

The release factor is a protein.

### L8 mRNA & translation

- Messenger RNA (mRNA) acts as a template for chaining together animo acids in a specific sequence
- The information within the coding sequence ar divided into codons, which are "words" made of 3 nucleotides each
  - Ex: AUG, CCG, AAA, CCC, UAA
  
### L8 Ribosomes, rRNA and translation

Ribosomes are protein synthesis machines!

- Made of proteins and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs)
- rRNA acts like an enzyme
- Physically links amino acids together
- Two components: small & large subunit
- Large subunit contains binding sites for tRNAs

### L8 tRNA and translation

- RNA molecules that carry amino acids to the ribosome
- tRNAs fold to form a specific structure
- tRNAs have specific anticodons and hold specific amino acids
- The anticodon is a three nucleotide sequence on a tRNA molecule that base pairs with the codons in an mRNA
  - Pay attention to the directionality of the codon and anticodon!
- Each amino acid corresponds with a specific codon via its anticodon

### L8 The Universal Genetic Code

The universal genetic code summarizes all 64 possible codons and their meaning in protein synthesis.

All three domains of life, plus viruses, use the universal genetic code (Some rare lineages and some mitochondria (including ours) have SMALL changes to the code). This has significant implications!

- The provides strong evidence that life arose just once.
- Consider what this means if we take genes from one species and place it in another! (We will discuss this more later).

![The universal genetic codon table](image-27.png).

Codons - 3 letter codes in mRNA; $4*4*4=64$ codons.

61 of which specify amino acids; 3 are stop codons that will stop protein synthesis.

More than one codon can code for the same amino acid.

This is why the genetic code is termed "degenerate" or "redundant"

This also means that translation cannot occur in reverse. Sequence information can only flow from RNA to protein.

This is a table of codons. These are written 5' to 3' and represent the triplets in mRNA.
