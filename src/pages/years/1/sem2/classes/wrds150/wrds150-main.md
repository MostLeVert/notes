## Lecture 2 (Two) Genre Theory 20240110

Genre is complicated.

Context + Form = Genre

Context is _purpose_ & _Audience_ together.

Form is _how_ its written, (like the form of an apple being, color shape, etc), in writing, length, vocabulary.

Both of these can be worked backward from, ex. purpose & audience will help determine form.

Consider: texts vs. emails

new stories have reading level of 8th grade. You're supposed to be able to understand everything very simply. Headline first, info later.

Creative writing doesn't always fit with the formula.

Advertisements have an audience & a message, audience is everything (not literally).

Belonging can be determined by the knowledge of acronyms, think of the LoL message board, someone can out themselves.

Genres can be pushed.

Instrument choice, banjo, vocal presentation (singing vs. rapping). What defines a song as country or hiphop. Community, and audience. Skin color in genre, black artist are very few in number who are full blown country music. Some people felt that the moving was over race.

Billboard decided which genre it belonged in, it has specific economic goals, etc. It defines the awards, radio stations, etc.

## Lecture 3 (Three) Paul Krugman The depravity of climate change denial 20240115

Krugman's main argument is: "And denying science for profit, political advantage or ego satisfaction is not O.K.; when
failure to act on the science may have terrible consequences, denial is, as I said, depraved." (Krugman 1)

Krugman provides a claim & 3 supporting arguments.

### Reading for gist Breaking texts down

Reading for gist, break the piece into sections. We can create links in the margin by having colors and lines, etc, and a few words. This allows you to have a reference to go back and look at what the article is saying, then we can go back and see the progression of the article.

1st: Attention getter.

2nd & 3rd: background information.

4th. back to the trump administration.

5th. Use of rhetorical question, to anticipate objections the audience may have. **This is important**. He's trying to throw a distractions and a position of power and knowledge, because he's answering the questions. This is a cheap trick that doesn't work in academic contexts.

6th. The main argument (everything above this is the introduction and setup).

7th 8th 9th. The 1st argument. This point has the most concrete evidence, and is the longest.

10th + 11th. Political advantage point 2

12th. Single sentence 3rd argument.

The rest. bringing everything together, and reenforces that these three reasons make climate deniers "depraved".

### Evidence (or lack thereof)

A book he's read (concrete source), it explicitly links his argument with the tobacco argument. This is an analogy -- he's building a bridge. Doing this requires good evidence on both sides of the analog. (Tobacco & companies deny for money, & same for climate change denial).

Using this source as a source of information on politics. The source is writing outside the expertise, (science vs. politics). It is an informal, non academic source. Krugman doesn't cite properly.

Do his claims have concrete evidence (No example, no source, etc.).

"As far as I can tell, every one of the handful of well-known scientists who have expressed climate skepticism has received large sums of money from these companies or from dark money conduits like DonorsTrust -- the same conduit, as it happens, that supported Matthew Whitaker, the new acting attorney general, before he joined the Trump administration." This sentence is not convincing, has no evidence. He's just saying things.

A DarkMoney conduit is when a company has a bunch of money to go people but don't want it traced to them.

Mathew Whitaker was getting bribed through these dark money conduits. (This has no relationship to climate change or scientists getting money). Again, Krugman is just saying things, no evidence with an "out" "As far as I can tell".

His argument on Republicans can be brought down by finding a single example, his argument is garbage.

On the third argument: "I have the impression that [...]" continuing with "[...] or something" This lacks any evidence.

Remember, this is a short opinion for a newspaper.

There are no references, there are no evidences. Thus we can say they expect that the audience isn't academic.

### Audience

The New York Times is a USA based news paper. It is written in accessible prose. The vocabulary is very simple. The New York Times tends to lean the left of the political spectrum. We can't argue an audience based on geographic etc. We would have to go more broad.

We can't assume anything that we feel.

The form is about the traditions within the news paper. (short sentences & paragraphs, etc). We can say that this is written for someone who expects to read an article in this form.

### Topic & Background

The information provided to the audience to give context.

This article assumes a lot of knowledge on the American system. Trump, parties, etc. But we can't say that this is for an American audience. Because there are people from other countries that know about the American system. We can't generalize to "Meant for Americans" we have to scale back to the evidence we can find & use. i.e. it's for someone who knows the American political system.

### Assumptions & Focus

The argument of this article isn't to argue that climate change is real, it's meant for people who already believe this. His main argument is taking climate change denial from "wrong" to "depraved". The assumptions made and the focus of the article indicate that Krugman assumes a certain alignment of opinion (climate change is real, denying it is bad).

**In academic context argument must match evidence!**

## Lecture 4 (four) Creating and Introducing Arguments 20240117

Note: Asynchronous materials

### On how we wrote in highschool

We generally have:

- Thesis
- Support Argument One
  - Topic sentence
  - Three pieces of supporting evidence
  - Concluding sentence
- Support Argument Two
- Support Argument Three

### Writing Now

We need a message, a main idea that we are arguing, this is the _focus_. We often have an argument developed over several paragraphs which develop the argument together. And each paragraph has a sub-focuses.

We need evidence. (We may not need evidence in Philosophy.), but most writing requires evidence.

We need analysis. We must present the evidence that we have & then we must provide an analysis which ties the evidence to the argument.

We need background information. This depends on the audience which means we must know our audience. To do this we read articles written by others in our particular field. We go through degrees and we take classes and we learn. We find the baseline level of knowledge that the audience has which will determine what we explain and we assume the audience knows. Background information may refer to such things as terminology or other information.

We need transitions (A more technical writing skill) which ties the "bricks" of the other elements of the writing to together, thus it is the "cement" of the writing. They can be entire sentences which connect ideas or words that connect sentences together. When we move between pieces of evidence we use a transition sentence to create a logical transition between the two sections.

It is not unusual for an academic paper to have an entire paragraph of background information. Also note that these things do not need to be a particular order. This means that we can "back into" a focus, and arguments. There is not requirement that background information comes all in one section. It can come before the section where it is referenced. We can decide if analysis should be in one section or multiple. We must fit to the argument and audience that we are targeting.

### Introducing arguments at the sentence level

Three main ways:

- Declarative statement: introduce argument as if it is a fact. Normally when we present the argument of an essay it is made as a declarative statement. If this cannot be done, then there is a problem with your main argument. We make the declarative statement when we are confident
  - Example: "The Trump administration is, it goes without saying, deeply anti-science." (Krugman 22). Not the phrasing which presents this as a fact.
  - Example: "Even though the novelty and drama surrounding climate change has since declined, the press has been persistent in its coverage, especially in its attention to scientific uncertainty. Scientific uncertainty has served as an important "frame"30 through which the science of climate change was presented in the press." (Zehr 88-89). Note the declarative statement, this declarative statement is only valid because he's done a shit ton of evidence to backup these declarative statements.
- Qualifiers: "seems, could, might, etc". Any time we are predicting or making educated guess, we need a qualifier. These statements often come in the conclusions of writings. Especially in scientific articles, where the conclusion make predictions about the future, or the papers potential impact in the future, etc.
  - Example: "But climate change isn't just killing people; it may well kidd civilization." (Krugman 22). Note the wording of "May" which is qualifier, denoting his prediction. Krugman also uses phrases such as "As far as I can tell". Let this raise a flag in your mind that highlights what may be a lack of evidence.
  - Example: "Three recurrent forms are explored, using the labels: scientific controversy, new research, and expansion of the problem domain. These forms are probably not unique to the global climate change phenomenon." (Zehr 90). Note the usage of the word "probably". Zehr hasn't done the research to prove his claim following "probably".
- Limiting expressions. When making generalizations, we use a limiting expression to allow for the possibility of exceptions. Words that serve this functionality are: "Usually, most, some, many, generally, partly, etc.".
  - Example: "But there are almost no good-faith climate-change deniers." (Krugman 22). Krugman is suggesting that there may be some good-faith climate change deniers. However, he's suggests that are very few of said people. But because he wants to acknowledge the possibility of exceptions he uses the word "almost"
  - Example: "Most accounts of new research involved novel means for measuring global warming or climate change". (Zehr 92). Here the limiting expression is "Most accounts".

## Lecture 5 (Five) Zehr 20240124

### Summarizing

Here is a paragraph that Zehr has written to make clear his arguments:

> The argument can be summarized in four successive points: (1) Scientific uncertainty was
>a highly salient theme in climate change articles; (2) Scientific uncertainty was constructed
>through various, sometimes unintentional, processes, including representations of controversy,
>new research topics, and an expanding problem domain; (3) Scientific uncertainty was managed
>in the press such that science remained an authoritative knowledge provider for climate change.
>An important part of this management involved the use of uncertainty in the construction
>of boundaries between science and the public; (4) These boundaries, in turn, constructed a
>“misinformed public” identity. This identity may itself be misinformed but, more importantly,
>it may contribute to inaction among publics who are so represented. (Zehr 98).

During your summary you must:

Communicate these things to someone who hasn't read the article.

Mention the 3 ways that uncertainty was managed.

Touch on the ideas relating to the public and science, and their understanding of it: Zehr's main ideas about the public and its relationship to the climate change literature. Ex. The public is very diverse, many people know vast amounts on the subject, others know nothing.

### Representative Arguments

They are the central way Zehr presents evidence & analysis to support his argument.

#### Representative Arguments (In General)

- General Statement - Through representative examples, instead of going though each event, you find one event that describes the overall trend you notice.
- Signal phrase: We need to signal that what follows is an example of what you're highlighting.
- Provide the example
- Tie it back into the larger context

For example:

**General Statement**: "Some apples are red."\
**Signal Phrase**: "For example,"\
**Example** "the apple I am eating right now is red."\
**Tie to Larger Context**: "I have seen many apples throughout my life that are also red."

#### How Zehr does it

Ex.

>Novelty was created in articles on global warming through the representation of a research\
>project or method as a fresh and inventive means for resolving a key question.\
>However, as this
>research was described, more scientific uncertainty was constructed. That is, each new study
>or technique was presented as important and novel precisely because it might answer hitherto
>unanswered but significant questions. The extensive focus on new research implied that there
>were many unanswered questions. Furthermore, scientists who were quoted in these articles
>typically reconfirmed this state of scientific uncertainty. (Zehr 92).

**Note**: furthermore is used when we are adding on to our general statement, what follows is an addition to his statement.

In the following paragraph Zehr's first sentence summarizes the paragraph we just analyzed. The second sentence is a kind of signal phrase, showing that the referenced article was typical in his research, note the wording "was typical" (Zehr 92).

When we are using representative examples we should have evidence and analysis together.

In the following paragraph he moves toward talking about the general trend, note that small mistake that Zehr made here in omitting in depth analysis for the specific example before moving on.

**Note**: The phrase "This format existed in many articles" (Zehr 92). Zehr should have linked this back to the specific example he just talked about. Then the tie between the evidence analysis and global trend is much smoother.

"Then" is a transition word that is helpful during article summary. ex. "Zehr does this **then** that".

In the first paragraph of section 4 is where Zehr ties back his example back to the global trend. Recall the example was coral bleaching, his tie back phrase is "Other examples that fit this pattern included".

He ends this paragraph with a sentence summarizing his global argument.

**Note**: Although his argument takes numerous paragraphs to setup, he is still following the general structured approach.

Recognize that there is a trust between you and the academic author, the line of trust differs between fields. Note that even though Zehr doesn't explain each and ever paper and example he used; we can reasonably trust what he's saying because he is citing/referencing other articles. Zehr's reputation is on the line as if his linked articles do not agree with what he is saying he would be ruined. So it is reasonably safe to say that it can mostly be trusted. If you don't believe it though, just check the linked papers.

### On Exercise 1

Although no one in the class submitted an exercise containing summaries not varied from the original enough. Prof. made up an example, showing that some phrases were almost identical to the original, with only a few words changed.

For the academic integrity test be extra sure that you are not committing bad things. If you cannot use quotation marks, then make sure you are using your own words.

**Note**: You have many opportunities to have Prof. review your work such that you might get a higher grade. (Students who delay their work, or do not get it reviewed tend to score much lower on this assignment).

### Long Summaries

#### Part of essay/article

They can be part of an essay or an article. If you spend at least 1 paragraph analyzing something it usually is a theory. In some cases we spend 1 paragraph summarizing someones ideas, or theory, or etc., and sometimes that's because we're going to go in an entirely different direction.

It is still important to consider your audience. Ask yourself if you already have an expectation of some knowledge on their part or not, do they need the summary or not.

Long summary lets you introduce how you will approach your arguments, etc.

#### Review article

A review article goes through other books or articles, summarizing them all. It's point is to get people "caught up" in the subject. They usually do not comment or critique the work

#### Annotated Bibliography

In annotated bibliographies we tend to have a focus, if we are summarizing a book, not everything in the book will be relevant, so we might state the what the book is all about, then dive into the one or two, or other, chapters, etc., that are relevant.

#### Book Review

Book reviews generally follow this formula:

- Topic and/or existing scholarship
- General summary (chapter breakdown)
- Specific example
- Praise
- Critique: generally they are written by recent graduates, people new to academia. They are generally reviewing books written by more seasoned academics. When a seasoned academic writes a book review it can be BRUTAL.
- value/appeal

### Our summary

It is critical that you treat the writing as if it is for someone who has not read the content.

Imagine that you are writing for other students in a different section of WRDS150. You must explain what you are saying properly.

#### Structure

Recall the general formula for writing

- Focus
- Evidence
- Analysis
- Background
- Transition

##### Focus

When we are writing a summary, the most important part is generally what about the book/article is novel, that is new to the field. That might be actual new data, however, in the humanities / social science, it is usually the argument that is new. When we are going through and choosing what to summary, find the main & supporting arguments. Those are the main points, those are what we must make clear in our summary.

##### Evidence

We can model the article by what each paragraph says. Be brief and talk about the type of evidence. If the data taking method for the article you are summarizing is of interest you can include. In a paragraph summary we want maybe 1-2 sentences about the TYPE of evidence the article uses.

##### Analysis

In summaries we aren't analyzing anything. We are not evaluating the article or anything. We are just speaking about the article in general

##### Background evidence

Remember that the level of required background depends on your audience. Recall that we are pretending we are writing for students in WRDS150 that haven't read the article.

##### Transitions

They are still important in summaries. If we hit all the points without transitions then it will read like a list. Use sequential transitions, i.e. "next", "then", etc.

#### Other considerations

##### Citations

Cite frequently; "anytime you move to a new idea or different section" (Connolly).

It is not enough to cite once at the end of the paragraph. We needs page numbers for particular sections that we are talking about. If we reference a sentence on page 3 we need to cite that; if you fail to do so you may be risking 50% of this assignments grade.

##### Quotes

For this assignment regarding quotes "use only if there is no way to paraphrase" (Connolly). The only time we should use quotes is when the technical language of the article cannot be paraphrased.

##### Signal Phrases

Use them occasional, if we have talked about something a lot for example, we can use a signal phrase.

##### Extra Tips

"Mention author, title, and main message near the beginning",
"Use formal language", "Remember your audience" (Connolly).

Don't use contractions in formal language; do not use slang or colloquial language.

## Lecture 6 workshop 20240129

Workshop - No notes.

## L7 Research Approaches

### Primary vs. Secondary Research

Different disciplines have differing ideas on how these differ. In many sciences, this might refer to data that you collect in a novel way. In our context (literature) primary sources are:

- Novels, poems, plays, short stories, letters, diaries, manuscripts, autobiographies, interviews, personal accounts.

In literature secondary sources (What others have already written).

- Journal articles, reviews, biographies, critical, books about writers and their works.

In social science it may be as follows:

Primary:

- Psychological tests; clinical case reports; surveys; reports of social workers, psychiatrists, etc,; interviews; oral histories; statistical data; field notes; fossils; photographs.

Secondary:

- Commentary and evaluations in reports, documents, journal articles, and books.

In the sciences;

Primary:

- Experiments, discoveries, test patterns, field notes, specimens, maps, geological surveys, patents, schematic drawings, technical reports, models.

Secondary:

- Interpretations and discussions of test data, found in journals and books.

The line between primary and secondary sources/research can be fuzzy; this occurs more in the non-scientific disciplines.

In Krugman's argument, the book _Madhouse Effect_ is a secondary source, and if we stretch a bit then the report mentioned at the end may be a primary research.

In Zehr's article; many different articles are referenced, his evidence comes from articles.

### Quantitative vs. Qualitative

In some disciplines authors may try and blend these two together; but in general, science is more quantitative and socials sciences/literature etc., are more qualitative.

Blending can occur, re: paper on the start of contemporary literature.

Krugman focuses mostly on qualitative. Zehr however focuses on qualitative as well; it is a language analysis. It is not data, or stats, or maths. Zehr uses lots of words like "many", "most", etc.

### Finding & Reporting vs. Interpreting

There are no academic articles that have only one or the other; however, most often there is an emphasis on one or the other. In sciences we may see reporting articles on new data. In humanities this is less often the case; if Hamlet is being written about, we needn't write about what it is about, only a novel interpreting is really useful. This isn't to say that there isn't new data in humanities, e.g. if someone found a new manuscript.

Science is not entirely objective; ex. someone arguing the use for their data (Subjective).

Krugman's piece is almost entirely interpreting. Zehr is more interpreting; but he also does lots of reporting. Is is far more balanced than Krugman's article.

### Subject Position

Make sure you understand this question **very clearly**.

Note that is is not the position an author takes on a subject; it is HOW the author positions HIMSELF as a subject. This can take the form of "I argue", the other end is talking about _who they are_, e.g. gender, race, educations. The reason someone would talk about these things is due to the fact that these may be variables in your research; these are the factors that might influence how you do research; you are a variable in your own research. Who you are effects the things you see but it also effects how people will react to you. This is why we must acknowledge this type of variable in the research.

Krugman uses the low end of subject positioning through grammar "I have", "I argue".

Zehr, uses very little subject positioning.

### Evaluating Scholarly Sources

Note: there is a lecture video & a quiz on this.

Note: This course will have strict rules; however, in the "real world" this definition may become more fuzzy.

- Source: Academic? Peer Reviewed?
  - There are two types of scholarly sources; if the publisher is academic then it qualifies. For journal articles it must be peer reviewed. In the humanities peer review it goes to a desk editor (An underpaid overworked grad student). They will give it the once over; and see if it's worth publishing. Then they will send it to 3 experts. Then you will get categorized, "Published as is with minor corrections" "published as in with large corrections", "Not published at all". In science this is condensed so sometimes mistakes make it through the peer review process. For essays we need minimum 6 scholarly sources (3 must be found on your own) that meet these qualifications.
- Author: Qualifications and Expertise
  - Re: the lobster mating psychology guy. Look at the degree, the past publications, etc. Make sure we are looking at the right author. Note that need that you must be sure you are looking at the right author.
- Response: Cited? Accepted?
  - Impact factor; the degree to which people use your work. Citations may talk about how WRONG or BAD an article is. This doesn't mean that the article is accepted.

Original Research or Argument; no review articles (Find the original article that was referenced); no dissertations (A good dissertation is a finished one (meaning it may contain errors, etc).  They are not published, nor peer reviewed).

Krugman isn't an academic source because: He's an economist not a political scientists. But it's easier to just realize that the NYT isn't an academic source. Krugman's opinion piece isn't peer reviewed or anything.

Zehr is, of course, an academic source.

Note: conflict's of interests are generally financial; stocks, funding, etc., conflicts of interesting doesn't mean that your data is necessarily bad; it just means the opportunity is there.

### The Final Essay

5 prompts to choose from:

- How are science and engineering articles different from humanities and social science articles? how are they the same. (Students in the past have wrote about article that are in their preferred fields).
- How has climate change denialism changed the past 20 years?
- What are the important elements to consider when studying climate change denialism.
- What should scholars and academics do bout climate change denialism how should they study it.
- How does climate change denialism compare to other forms of science denialism.

Finding research/exploring for the finale exam. e.g. In the case of "How has social media changed climate change denialism"

- Look for: Articles on climate change denialism and social media.
- Look for: Articles on social media and political discussion or science denialism more broadly.
- Articles on climate change denialism more generally.
- Examples of climate change denialism on social media (Independent Research). Note that you should apply the principles of secondary research.

## Lecture L8 Harrison

She yaps incessantly. Separation of powers between the states; states have quite some autonomy.

### Electoral Disincentive

The things that decrease you odds of being elected.

Think about it as the difference between reward and punishment. If you have a pet or a child you may create an incentive by creating a reward. If you punish them for something, that is a disincentive. In a politics a politician has a incentive to do things to get elected, but they also have a disincentive. Consider funding that has the condition of you not supporting climate change policy.

### Weak Party Discipline

Someone wouldn't be voted out for voting against their party. In Canada there is a punishment for voting against your party. In the USA if a person votes against their party there is nothing wrong with that. In Canada we have "party accountability".

#### South Park Analogy

It creates too extremes to create a middle. Eventually you will realize the center that is created leans toward the right. They use the crazy to make themselves appear more reasonable. This is what the lack of accountability does for a person/party.

### Separation of Power

The house the congress the senate all work independently, but they all must agree for a policy or piece of legislation to be passed. There are countless. In Canada the senate makes sure that any legislation doesn't break anything in the charter of fundamental rights.

## WK5 Feb7 L2 Harrison Continued

### WK5L2 Argument

"However, while clearly a significant part of the problem, to date the United States has not been part of the solution."

We setup a problem that we want to understand.

### WK5L2 Using Evidence to Construct an Argument

"If there are enhanced electoral disincentives, why would a politician support climate change legislation?"

Note: It is very, extremely, hard to answer these broad general question. Even Harrison didn't answer it, she rather specified the question to:

"If there are enhanced electoral disincentives, why would AL Gore and Bill Clinton advocate for the kyoto protocol?"

Resting on the idea "A causal belief that climate change is both real and caused by human activities and a principled belief that his or her country has a responsibility to help mitigate the problem".

Vice president Gore's values to a large degree explain the United States' original consent to the Kyoto protocol in the face of significant political obstacles. (93, Political science and prediction: What's next for U.S. Climate Change Policy? Review of Policy Research 24 (1):1-27)

### WK5L2 Integrating Quotes

The science was unproven reductions could be economically rouens. She does a transition "In Response", then (Harrison) does some things in terms of writing in some stuff that comes from later in Carter's Paper. Then she has a clause which is partially a summary of what carter says; but partly a summary of what companies are doing. Then she gets into what they are arguing. The actual arguments must be quoted directly because Carter has already said his arguments in a very clear way. She later quotes Gary Bryner; saying " Gary Bryner notes that in the United States "cheap energy is a widely help olitical mantra that causes politicians and citizens alike to fear policies on climate change or any other issue that might threaten to raise energy prices. it is not always relevant to mention everything about an author,. The choice of what is relevant or not is up to the user.

From page 70. "In 2007 members of the US Climate Action Partnership, including environmental groups Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council ..." This comes from the website which outlines the goals of th organization. However, they don't list the members. Harrison however, provides the date, and the people/companies, etc, involved in the partnership.If we combine two sources in MLA we usually because two articles come to the conclusion. Ex. "This is what studies found (citation, citation, etc.).

> The Arrival in Kyoto of Vice President Al Gore and his direction to the US delegation "To show increased negotiating flexibility" was critical to break the impasse between the negotiating blocs. (80).

Why does Harrison not quote the article because the paper that Harrison citied is where the idea that was expressed within the news article impacted. The arrival in Kyoto by President... is the setup, and "his" and "direction to the US delegation is further setup, resulting in the quote "to show increased negotiating flexibility" which then effect is analyses her "Was critical to breaking the impasse betweens the negotiating blocs".  We don't know. Harrison saves a bit of room; but this isn't important, the important bit it he acknowledgement of where the idea came from, that is that article that quoted the newspaper article.

note: this isn't a huge part of the course, but there is one section on the final essay rubric, which analyzes how well you integrated quotes.

Hedging as in finance.

## Lecture L9 Proposals

Proposals are relevant to:

- Student Projects
- Funding
- CFP's

### Attention Getter

It isn't super important, but ideally you give someone an idea of what project you're doing and why it might be important.

A really good attention getter is something that can push you into the higher grades, exceptional grades.

### Summary of Existing Work

We need six (6) academic source; we will need to provide a concise clear condensed summary of the sources; not individually but grouped together. That is, summarize the sources in a group.

### The Gap or Knowledge Deficit

This is so we can establish what hasn't already been done. Then we can say that we are going to do what hasn't already been.

### Methodology

Each discipline creates their own ways to do methodology. What kind of evidence are you going to use, where are you going to get it from, and how you are going to analyze it. What are we actually looking for; specifically in some terms. Just simply state how we are going to do the methodology. Has to be more specific than, for example, just looking for some differences; you would need to specify what type of difference we are looking for.

### Value

Value is what puts you over the top; but value is subjective. It is based on what someone else wants, and your ability to give it to them. This is less important for student projects; they are just making sure you can do it within the general requirements, however, in the "real world", ex., applying for conferences, etc.

### Examples

#### IPV Example

Dealing with IPV; for some reason this is what you will find on engineering CFP's.

Note: in our class, our proposals are too short for subheadings, in the field you will need them, sometimes, but in this class we do not use subheadings.

#### Contrived Example

Again, do not summarize each source.

Ex. "Other scholars are less overtly critical, but tend to repeat the genre pioneering narrative introduced by the mainstream press (Shuck; Blodgett) or focus on Peretti's connection to conservation politics (Gribben; Howard).

If something is essential to the paper we are proposing we can include more information in our summary.

In this example, the gap is something that most previous papers have not included, it is usually one sentence.

#### Megan Fox Example

There wasn't a clear identification of a knowledge deficit or a gap. There is a summary of previous work, but no identification of the aforementioned knowledge deficit or gap. However, this is a somewhat under researched subject in academia. There were zero mentioned of previous papers that touch on celebrities communications with the public, or concerning religion.

The methodology is OK, could be far, far, far, clearer.

The value of the proposed paper isn't super clear. It could be worded slightly better and make a better case for its value.

Make sure that you network, because this "bad" proposal was accepted due to a personal relationship with the person who decides whether we accept a proposal or not.
