## Lecture 2 - Genre Theory - January 10 2024, 2024/01/10

Genre is complicated.

Context + Form = Genre

Context is _purpose_ & _Audience_ together.

Form is _how_ its written, (like the form of an apple being, color shape, etc), in writing, length, vocabulary.

Both of these can be worked backward from, ex. purpose & audience will help determine form.

Consider: texts vs. emails

new stories have reading level of 8th grade. You're supposed to be able to understand everything very simply. Headline first, info later.

Creative writing doesn't always fit with the formula.

Advertisements have an audience & a message, audience is everything (not literally).

Belonging can be determined by the knowledge of acronyms, think of the LoL message board, someone can out themselves.

Genres can be pushed.

Instrument choice, banjo, vocal presentation (singing vs. rapping). What defines a song as country or hiphop. Community, and audience. Skin color in genre, black artist are very few in number who are full blown country music. Some people felt that the moving was over race.

Billboard decided which genre it belonged in, it has specific economic goals, etc. It defines the awards, radio stations, etc.

## Lecture 3 - Paul Krugman "The depravity of climate change denial" - January 15 2024, 2024/01/15

Krugman's main argument is: "And denying science for profit, political advantage or ego satisfaction is not O.K.; when
failure to act on the science may have terrible consequences, denial is, as I said, depraved." (Krugman 1)

Krugman provides a claim & 3 supporting arguments.

### Reading for gist Breaking texts down

Reading for gist, break the piece into sections. We can create links in the margin by having colors and lines, etc, and a few words. This allows you to have a reference to go back and look at what the article is saying, then we can go back and see the progression of the article.

1st: Attention getter.

2nd & 3rd: background information.

4th. back to the trump administration.

5th. Use of rhetorical question, to anticipate objections the audience may have. **This is important**. He's trying to throw a distractions and a position of power and knowledge, because he's answering the questions. This is a cheap trick that doesn't work in academic contexts.

6th. The main argument (everything above this is the introduction and setup).

7th 8th 9th. The 1st argument. This point has the most concrete evidence, and is the longest.

10th + 11th. Political advantage point 2

12th. Single sentence 3rd argument.

The rest. bringing everything together, and reenforces that these three reasons make climate deniers "depraved".

### Evidence (or lack thereof)

A book he's read (concrete source), it explicitly links his argument with the tobacco argument. This is an analogy -- he's building a bridge. Doing this requires good evidence on both sides of the analog. (Tobacco & companies deny for money, & same for climate change denial).

Using this source as a source of information on politics. The source is writing outside the expertise, (science vs. politics). It is an informal, non academic source. Krugman doesn't cite properly.

Do his claims have concrete evidence (No example, no source, etc.).

"As far as I can tell, every one of the handful of well-known scientists who have expressed climate skepticism has received large sums of money from these companies or from dark money conduits like DonorsTrust -- the same conduit, as it happens, that supported Matthew Whitaker, the new acting attorney general, before he joined the Trump administration." This sentence is not convincing, has no evidence. He's just saying things.

A DarkMoney conduit is when a company has a bunch of money to go people but don't want it traced to them.

Mathew Whitaker was getting bribed through these dark money conduits. (This has no relationship to climate change or scientists getting money). Again, Krugman is just saying things, no evidence with an "out" "As far as I can tell".

His argument on Republicans can be brought down by finding a single example, his argument is garbage.

On the third argument: "I have the impression that [...]" continuing with "[...] or something" This lacks any evidence.

Remember, this is a short opinion for a newspaper.

There are no references, there are no evidences. Thus we can say they expect that the audience isn't academic.

### Audience

The New York Times is a USA based news paper. It is written in accessible prose. The vocabulary is very simple. The New York Times tends to lean the left of the political spectrum. We can't argue an audience based on geographic etc. We would have to go more broad.

We can't assume anything that we feel.

The form is about the traditions within the news paper. (short sentences & paragraphs, etc). We can say that this is written for someone who expects to read an article in this form.

### Topic & Background

The information provided to the audience to give context.

This article assumes a lot of knowledge on the American system. Trump, parties, etc. But we can't say that this is for an American audience. Because there are people from other countries that know about the American system. We can't generalize to "Meant for Americans" we have to scale back to the evidence we can find & use. i.e. it's for someone who knows the American political system.

### Assumptions & Focus

The argument of this article isn't to argue that climate change is real, it's meant for people who already believe this. His main argument is taking climate change denial from "wrong" to "depraved". The assumptions made and the focus of the article indicate that Krugman assumes a certain alignment of opinion (climate change is real, denying it is bad).

**In academic context argument must match evidence!**
