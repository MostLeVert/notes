## Lecture 2 (Two) Genre Theory 20240110

Genre is complicated.

Context + Form = Genre

Context is _purpose_ & _Audience_ together.

Form is _how_ its written, (like the form of an apple being, color shape, etc), in writing, length, vocabulary.

Both of these can be worked backward from, ex. purpose & audience will help determine form.

Consider: texts vs. emails

new stories have reading level of 8th grade. You're supposed to be able to understand everything very simply. Headline first, info later.

Creative writing doesn't always fit with the formula.

Advertisements have an audience & a message, audience is everything (not literally).

Belonging can be determined by the knowledge of acronyms, think of the LoL message board, someone can out themselves.

Genres can be pushed.

Instrument choice, banjo, vocal presentation (singing vs. rapping). What defines a song as country or hiphop. Community, and audience. Skin color in genre, black artist are very few in number who are full blown country music. Some people felt that the moving was over race.

Billboard decided which genre it belonged in, it has specific economic goals, etc. It defines the awards, radio stations, etc.

## Lecture 3 (Three) Paul Krugman "The depravity of climate change denial" 20240115

Krugman's main argument is: "And denying science for profit, political advantage or ego satisfaction is not O.K.; when
failure to act on the science may have terrible consequences, denial is, as I said, depraved." (Krugman 1)

Krugman provides a claim & 3 supporting arguments.

### Reading for gist Breaking texts down

Reading for gist, break the piece into sections. We can create links in the margin by having colors and lines, etc, and a few words. This allows you to have a reference to go back and look at what the article is saying, then we can go back and see the progression of the article.

1st: Attention getter.

2nd & 3rd: background information.

4th. back to the trump administration.

5th. Use of rhetorical question, to anticipate objections the audience may have. **This is important**. He's trying to throw a distractions and a position of power and knowledge, because he's answering the questions. This is a cheap trick that doesn't work in academic contexts.

6th. The main argument (everything above this is the introduction and setup).

7th 8th 9th. The 1st argument. This point has the most concrete evidence, and is the longest.

10th + 11th. Political advantage point 2

12th. Single sentence 3rd argument.

The rest. bringing everything together, and reenforces that these three reasons make climate deniers "depraved".

### Evidence (or lack thereof)

A book he's read (concrete source), it explicitly links his argument with the tobacco argument. This is an analogy -- he's building a bridge. Doing this requires good evidence on both sides of the analog. (Tobacco & companies deny for money, & same for climate change denial).

Using this source as a source of information on politics. The source is writing outside the expertise, (science vs. politics). It is an informal, non academic source. Krugman doesn't cite properly.

Do his claims have concrete evidence (No example, no source, etc.).

"As far as I can tell, every one of the handful of well-known scientists who have expressed climate skepticism has received large sums of money from these companies or from dark money conduits like DonorsTrust -- the same conduit, as it happens, that supported Matthew Whitaker, the new acting attorney general, before he joined the Trump administration." This sentence is not convincing, has no evidence. He's just saying things.

A DarkMoney conduit is when a company has a bunch of money to go people but don't want it traced to them.

Mathew Whitaker was getting bribed through these dark money conduits. (This has no relationship to climate change or scientists getting money). Again, Krugman is just saying things, no evidence with an "out" "As far as I can tell".

His argument on Republicans can be brought down by finding a single example, his argument is garbage.

On the third argument: "I have the impression that [...]" continuing with "[...] or something" This lacks any evidence.

Remember, this is a short opinion for a newspaper.

There are no references, there are no evidences. Thus we can say they expect that the audience isn't academic.

### Audience

The New York Times is a USA based news paper. It is written in accessible prose. The vocabulary is very simple. The New York Times tends to lean the left of the political spectrum. We can't argue an audience based on geographic etc. We would have to go more broad.

We can't assume anything that we feel.

The form is about the traditions within the news paper. (short sentences & paragraphs, etc). We can say that this is written for someone who expects to read an article in this form.

### Topic & Background

The information provided to the audience to give context.

This article assumes a lot of knowledge on the American system. Trump, parties, etc. But we can't say that this is for an American audience. Because there are people from other countries that know about the American system. We can't generalize to "Meant for Americans" we have to scale back to the evidence we can find & use. i.e. it's for someone who knows the American political system.

### Assumptions & Focus

The argument of this article isn't to argue that climate change is real, it's meant for people who already believe this. His main argument is taking climate change denial from "wrong" to "depraved". The assumptions made and the focus of the article indicate that Krugman assumes a certain alignment of opinion (climate change is real, denying it is bad).

**In academic context argument must match evidence!**

### On how we wrote in highschool

We generally have:

- Thesis
- Support Argument One
  - Topic sentence
  - Three pieces of supporting evidence
  - Concluding sentence
- Support Argument Two
- Support Argument Three

### Writing Now

We need a message, a main idea that we are arguing, this is the _focus_. We often have an argument developed over several paragraphs which develop the argument together. And each paragraph has a sub-focuses.

We need evidence. (We may not need evidence in Philosophy.), but most writing requires evidence.

We need analysis. We must present the evidence that we have & then we must provide an analysis which ties the evidence to the argument.

We need background information. This depends on the audience which means we must know our audience. To do this we read articles written by others in our particular field. We go through degrees and we take classes and we learn. We find the baseline level of knowledge that the audience has which will determine what we explain and we assume the audience knows. Background information may refer to such things as terminology or other information.

We need transitions (A more technical writing skill) which ties the "bricks" of the other elements of the writing to together, thus it is the "cement" of the writing. They can be entire sentences which connect ideas or words that connect sentences together. When we move between pieces of evidence we use a transition sentence to create a logical transition between the two sections.

It is not unusual for an academic paper to have an entire paragraph of background information. Also note that these things do not need to be a particular order. This means that we can "back into" a focus, and arguments. There is not requirement that background information comes all in one section. It can come before the section where it is referenced. We can decide if analysis should be in one section or multiple. We must fit to the argument and audience that we are targeting.

### Introducing arguments at the sentence level

Three main ways:

- Declarative statement: introduce argument as if it is a fact. Normally when we present the argument of an essay it is made as a declarative statement. If this cannot be done, then there is a problem with your main argument. We make the declarative statement when we are confident
  - Example: "The Trump administration is, it goes without saying, deeply anti-science." (Krugman 22). Not the phrasing which presents this as a fact.
  - Example: "Even though the novelty and drama surrounding climate change has since declined, the press has been persistent in its coverage, especially in its attention to scientific uncertainty. Scientific uncertainty has served as an important "frame"30 through which the science of climate change was presented in the press." (Zehr 88-89). Note the declarative statement, this declarative statement is only valid because he's done a shit ton of evidence to backup these declarative statements.
- Qualifiers: "seems, could, might, etc". Any time we are predicting or making educated guess, we need a qualifier. These statements often come in the conclusions of writings. Especially in scientific articles, where the conclusion make predictions about the future, or the papers potential impact in the future, etc.
  - Example: "But climate change isn't just killing people; it may well kidd civilization." (Krugman 22). Note the wording of "May" which is qualifier, denoting his prediction. Krugman also uses phrases such as "As far as I can tell". Let this raise a flag in your mind that highlights what may be a lack of evidence.
  - Example: "Three recurrent forms are explored, using the labels: scientific controversy, new research, and expansion of the problem domain. These forms are probably not unique to the global climate change phenomenon." (Zehr 90). Note the usage of the word "probably". Zehr hasn't done the research to prove his claim following "probably".
- Limiting expressions. When making generalizations, we use a limiting expression to allow for the possibility of exceptions. Words that serve this functionality are: "Usually, most, some, many, generally, partly, etc.".
  - Example: "But there are almost no good-faith climate-change deniers." (Krugman 22). Krugman is suggesting that there may be some good-faith climate change deniers. However, he's suggests that are very few of said people. But because he wants to acknowledge the possibility of exceptions he uses the word "almost"
  - Example: "Most accounts of new research involved novel means for measuring global warming or climate change". (Zehr 92). Here the limiting expression is "Most accounts".

### Long Summaries

#### Part of essay/article

They can be part of an essay or an article. If you spend at least 1 paragraph analyzing something it usually is a theory. In some cases we spend 1 paragraph summarizing someones ideas, or theory, or etc., and sometimes that's because we're going to go in an entirely different direction.

It is still important to consider your audience. Ask yourself if you already have an expectation of some knowledge on their part or not, do they need the summary or not.

Long summary lets you introduce how you will approach your arguments, etc.

#### Review article

A review article goes through other books or articles, summarizing them all. It's point is to get people "caught up" in the subject. They usually do not comment or critique the work

#### Annotated Bibliography

In annotated bibliographies we tend to have a focus, if we are summarizing a book, not everything in the book will be relevant, so we might state the what the book is all about, then dive into the one or two, or other, chapters, etc., that are relevant.

#### Book Review

Book reviews generally follow this formula:

- Topic and/or existing scholarship
- General summary (chapter breakdown)
- Specific example
- Praise
- Critique: generally they are written by recent graduates, people new to academia. They are generally reviewing books written by more seasoned academics. When a seasoned academic writes a book review it can be BRUTAL.
- value/appeal

### Our summary

It is critical that you treat the writing as if it is for someone who has not read the content.

Imagine that you are writing for other students in a different section of WRDS150. You must explain what you are saying properly.

#### Structure

Recall the general formula for writing

- Focus
- Evidence
- Analysis
- Background
- Transition

##### Focus

When we are writing a summary, the most important part is generally what about the book/article is novel, that is new to the field. That might be actual new data, however, in the humanities / social science, it is usually the argument that is new. When we are going through and choosing what to summary, find the main & supporting arguments. Those are the main points, those are what we must make clear in our summary.

##### Evidence

We can model the article by what each paragraph says. Be brief and talk about the type of evidence. If the data taking method for the article you are summarizing is of interest you can include. In a paragraph summary we want maybe 1-2 sentences about the TYPE of evidence the article uses.

##### Analysis

In summaries we aren't analyzing anything. We are not evaluating the article or anything. We are just speaking about the article in general

##### Background evidence

Remember that the level of required background depends on your audience. Recall that we are pretending we are writing for students in WRDS150 that haven't read the article.

##### Transitions

They are still important in summaries. If we hit all the points without transitions then it will read like a list. Use sequential transitions, i.e. "next", "then", etc.

#### Other considerations

##### Citations

Cite frequently; "anytime you move to a new idea or different section" (Connolly).

It is not enough to cite once at the end of the paragraph. We needs page numbers for particular sections that we are talking about. If we reference a sentence on page 3 we need to cite that; if you fail to do so you may be risking 50% of this assignments grade.

##### Quotes

For this assignment regarding quotes "use only if there is no way to paraphrase" (Connolly). The only time we should use quotes is when the technical language of the article cannot be paraphrased.

##### Signal Phrases

Use them occasional, if we have talked about something a lot for example, we can use a signal phrase.

##### Extra tips

"Mention author, title, and main message near the beginning",
"Use formal language", "Remember your audience" (Connolly).

Don't use contractions in formal language; do not use slang or colloquial language.
